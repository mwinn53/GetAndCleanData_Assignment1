## Files
In addition to this README, this repository contains the following files:
* **CodeBook.md**

    Contains a description and value range for the variables in the tidydata.txt

*   **run_analysis.R**

    Contains the code to read, process, and output the tidy data set (tidydata.txt).
    
    The code is self-documented, and no additional libraries are required.
    
    run_analysis.R assumes it is in a directory with the extracted 
    UCI HAR Dataset with the following structure:
        
        ./run_analyis.R
        ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/
        ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/

    As specified in the assignment, the UCI HAR Dataset was retreived from   (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
